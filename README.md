 Simulation of disease transmission in a population

# References:

# Roadmap:
1. population density
2. add "sociability" to adjust motion - reduce motion once infected
3. add r0/adjust beta/gamma for real-world disease, e.g. covid

# Added:
1. ~~add time to recovery~~
2. ~~color map of dot to show stage of infection~~
