 Simulation of disease transmission in a population

# Roadmap:
1. population density (e.g. rural, suburban, urban)
2. reduce motion once infected, based on a quadratic curve?
3. add r0/adjust beta/gamma for real-world disease, e.g. covid
4. add info box when a dot is clicked to show time of infection, status, location, sociability, etc.
5. add reported cases, hospitalizations, online trends
6. add mortality
7. add city-specific data, e.g. LA
8. replace beta with something more real-world, e.g. based on distance-time
9. show SIR live plot

# Added:
1. ~~add time to recovery~~
2. ~~color map of dot to show stage of infection~~
3. ~~add "sociability" to adjust motion~~
